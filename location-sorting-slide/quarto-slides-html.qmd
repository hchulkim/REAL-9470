## Motivation

#### Amenity, sorting, inquality

#### Amenity is endogenous

- (Local) Amenity is not a fixed value but an equilibrium outcome.
  - Households make location choices based on their [heterogeneous preferences]{.alert} on different [dimension]{.alert} of amenities.
  - Local amenities cater to the need of the demographic composition in their neighborhoods.
