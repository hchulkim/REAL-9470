## Motivation

#### Amenity, sorting, inquality

- Socioeconomic inequality is tightly linked to residential choice.

- Important mechanism that amplifies this inequality: [Endogenous amenity]{.alert}.

#### Amenity is endogenous

- (Local) Amenity is not a fixed value but an equilibrium outcome.
  - Households make location choices based on their [heterogeneous preferences]{.alert} on different [dimension]{.alert} of amenities.
  - Local amenities cater to the need of the demographic composition in their neighborhoods.

Thus, fully characterizing this nature of ***endogenous amenity*** is important in understanding its effect on welfare inquality.

## Challenges in prior literature

#### Crude understanding of the nature of amenity

- Amenities are typically modeled as a one-dimensional object (aggregating the variety of location characteristics).

#### Aggregation of amenity into single-index does not allow...

- Households' diverse tastes for different consumption amenities **(horizontal differentiation of neighborhood on the demand side)**.

- Fims providing such amenities cater to this heterogeneity **(differential supply-side responses to consumer heterogeneity)**.

- A more full picture to help design policies that alleviate urban inequality.

[Possibly due to lack of data, model, shock, etc.]{.alert}

## Research question

#### How does preference heterogeneity over multiple endogenous consumption amenities shape with-city residential sorting and inequality?

- How does significant change in local residential composition (e.g. tourism in Amsterdam) affect local residential markets (rental price) and amenity markets (change in local amenities for residents and tourists).

## Methodology

#### "Reduced-form" regression to show stylized facts and motivation

- Shift-share IV regression to causally estimate the impact of mass tourism on local housing and amenity markets.

- Identification: ["Shift"]{.alert} *(time variation in worldwide demand for STR)* - ["Share"]{.alert} *(neighborhood-level exposure to tourism using spatial distribution of historic monuments)*

  - Higher STR entry led to higher rental price.
  - Amenities have tilted toward tourists and away from locals.
  - The composition of residents has changed heterogeneously across neighborhoods.

#### "Structural model"

- Build a dynamic model of a city's rental market that consists of:

  (i) Heterogeneous households and tourist making location decisions,
  (ii) Landlords who can rent their units to local or tourists,
  (iii) A market for amenities that microfounds how the composition of amenities endogenously responds to the composition of locals and tourists.

## Related literature

#### Spatial equilibrium model: Benchmark to study spatial inequality across and within cities

- Focus on within-city margin but silent on the mechanisms through which specific amenities are provided: Bayer et al. (2007); Guerrieri et al. (2013); Ahlfeldt et al. (2015); Su (2022).

- Impose structure on amenity but lack heterogeneity in residents' preferences over amenities or collapse amenities into a single quality index: Couture et al. (2021); hoelzlein (2020); Miyauchi et al. (2021).

  - This paper contributes by allowing for preference heterogeneity over multiple and differentiated amenities.

## Data overview

#### Individual-level data: Statistical bureau of the Netherlands' Centraal Bureau voor de Statistiek (CBS)

- Construct a panel of residential history for the universe of individuals $+$ household-level demographics from tax return data (income, education, employment status, etc).

#### Housing unit data: CBS tax appraisal panel and national rent survey 

- Universe of residential housing units (property value, occupant's tenancy status, rental prices, etc). 

#### Neighborhood-level data: Amsterdam City Data (ACD)

- Two level of geographic units: 99 neighborhoods (wijk) in 25 larger districts (gebied).

- ACD: Annual neighborhood-level outcomes (ethnic, income, rich set of consumption amenities, city-level tourist inflows).

- Set of amenities are narrowed down to six: Restaurants, bars, food stores, non-food stores, nurseries, and "touristic amenities."

#### Short-term rental (STR) listings: Airbnb listing-level observations (geo-coordinates, prices, etc)

***Final sample: Annual panel of location choices and characteristics for 2008-2018 in 22 districts.***

## Descriptive evidence

- [Fact 1]{.alert}: Tourists and STR listings have grown dramatically and sprawled across Amsterdam.

- [Fact 2]{.alert}: Rents have increased more in neighborhoods with more STR entry.

- [Fact 3]{.alert}: Amenities have tilted towards tourists and away from locals.

- [Fact 4]{.alert}: The composition of residents has changed heterogeneously across neighborhoods.

## Economic model 1: Endogenous amenities {#sec-amenity-eq}

**Notation**: $J+1$ locations; $K$ types of locals and tourist type $T$;  $S$ sectors; Population composition $M_{jt} \equiv [M_{jt}^1, ... , M_{jt}^K, M_{jt}^T]'$; Amenities $a_{jt} \equiv [N_{1jt}, ..., N_{sjt}]'$

#### Demand for amenities

Household with Cobb-Douglas (CD) perferences over housing $H$ and amenities $C$, CD preferences across amenity sector and CES preferences over varieties within a sector:

$$q_{isjt} = \sum_k q_{isjt}^k M_{jt}^k, \quad \text{where} \, \, q_{isjt}^k = \frac{\alpha_s^k \phi^k \omega_t^k}{p_{isjt}}\left( \frac{p_{isjt}}{P_{sjt}}\right)^{1-\sigma_s}$$

#### Supply of amenities (monopolistic competition, same marginal cost, free entry): Zero-profit condition

$$(p_{sjt} - c_{sjt}) q_{sjt} = \underbrace{F_{sjt}(N_{jt})}_{\text{Fixed cost per period}}, \quad \text{where} \, \, N_{jt} = \sum_s N_{sjt}.$$

#### Equilibrium amenities: Adding up equations above gives market clearing condition [[back]{.button}](#sec-amenity-est)

$$N_{sjt} = \frac{1}{\sigma_s F_{sjt}} \sum_k \alpha_s^k \phi^k \omega_t^k M_{jt}^k, \quad a_{jt}=A(M_{jt})$$ 

## Economic model 2: Housing supply {#sec-housingsupply}

- Total housing stock (measured in units of floor space) $H_{jt}$ is assumed to be inelastic in the short-rn and follows an exogenously determined path over time. [[Justfication]{.button}](#sec-justification)

- A continuum of absentee landlords make a binary choice between renting in the long-term market (LT) or in the short-term market (ST).

#### An individual landlord's problem

$$\max\{ \alpha \cdot \overbrace{\gamma_{jt}}^{\text{LT income}} + \varepsilon_{LT}, \, \, \alpha \cdot \underbrace{p_{jt}}_{\text{ST income}} - \overbrace{\kappa_{jt}}^{\text{operating cost}} + \varepsilon_{ST} \},$$

#### Housing supply in each location ($\varepsilon \sim \text{T1EV}$)

$$H_{jt}^{LT,S} (\gamma_{jt}, p_{jt}) = \frac{\exp(\alpha \gamma_{jt})}{\exp (\alpha \gamma_{jt}) + \exp(\alpha p_{jt} - \kappa_{jt})} H_{jt},$$

$$H_{jt}^{ST,S} (\gamma_{jt}, p_{jt}) = H_{jt} - H_{jt}^{LT,S} (\gamma_{jt}, p_{jt}).$$

[[back]{.button}](#sec-supply-est)

## Economic model 3-1: Housing demand (locals)

#### Dynamic location choice of locals

- Invidual state variables: Location $j_{it-1}$ and Tenure $\tau_{jt-1}$.

- Aggregate state variables: Rent $\gamma_t$, Amenities $a_t$, Exogenous location attributes $b_t$, and unobservable factors $\zeta_t$.

#### Household $i$'s dynamic problem (value function)

$$V^k (x_{it}, \varepsilon_{it}, \underbrace{\omega_{t}}_{\text{aggregate state}}) = \max_{j \in \{ 0, 1, ..., J \}} u^k (j, x_{jt}, \omega_{t}) + \varepsilon_{ijt} + \beta \mathbb{E} \left[ V^k(x_{it+1}, \varepsilon_{it+1}, \omega_{t+1}) \mid j, x_{it}, \varepsilon_{it} \right].$$

- If we assume $\varepsilon_{ijt} \sim \text{T1EV}$, we can also get probability a type $k$ household chooses $j$, conditional on state $x_{it}$: $\mathbb{P}_{t}^k (j \mid x_{it})$.

- We can also denote $\pi_t^k (j, \tau)$ as type $k$'s joint probability of living in location $j$ with tenure $\tau$ at the end of period $t$.

- Then, type $k$ population count for location $j$ is: $M_{jt}^k (\gamma_t, a_t) = \sum_\tau \pi_t^k (j, \tau) M_t^k \quad \forall k \in \{ 1, ...,K \}$.

## Economic model 3-2: Housing demand (tourists)

$\exists$ an exogenous number of tourists $M_t^T$ arriving into the city and choosing to stay in a short-term rental or a hotel. 

#### Tourists in short-term rentals

- Payoff for tourists in STR: $u_{jt}^{ST} = \delta_j^{ST} + \delta_{t}^{ST} + \delta_p^{ST} \log p_{jt} + \delta_a^{ST} \log a_{jt} + \zeta_{jt}^{ST}.$

- (number of tourists staying in STR): $M_{jt}^{ST} (p_t, a_t) = \frac{\exp (u_{jt}^{ST})}{\sum_{j' = 0}^J \exp (u_{j't}^{ST})} \cdot M_t^T$.

#### Tourists in hotels

- Distribute total number of tourists in hotel in proportion to the hotel capacity observed in the data.

## Economic model 4: Equilibrium

Population composition, rents, STR prices, and amenities are endogenously and jointly determined in stationary equilibrium.

:::{.callout-important icon="false"}
## Definition (Stationary equilibrium) - Brief version

In ***stationary equilibrium***,

1. the long-term rental market clears for every location,

2. the short-term rental market clears for every location,

3. the amenities market clears.

## (Brief) Counterfactuals and robustness checks

#### Counterfactuals

- Compare it with homogeneous preference specification: Less sorting, higher inequality.

- STR tax or a touristic amenities (TA) tax: Monotonic welfare increase for STR tax, but more nuanced for TA tax.

#### Robustness of real estate supply elasticity

- The paper's main counterfactuals are robust to different supply elasticities, ranging from the baseline inelastic San Francisco case to the highly elastic case of Atlanta.

#### Comparison of static and dynamic model estimates

- Examine the impact of removing forward-looking behavior ($\beta = 0$) and location capital, i.e., the dynamic state-dependent component of moving costs.

- Most of the coefficients of the demand estimates become significantly different, hinting the importance of dynamic component in the model.

## Conclusion

- This paper studies the role of preference heterogeneity over a set of endogenous location amenities in shaping within-city sorting and welfare inequality.

  - Build a model of residential choice where heterogeneous, forward-looking households consume a bundle of amenities provided by firms in a market for non-tradables. 
  - Unlike past literature, the paper microfounds how different consumption amenities arise in equilibrium, endogenizing the extent to which neighborhoods become horizontally differentiated.

#### Empirical findings

- Heterogeneity in the preferences of residents and supply responses of firms are substantial.

- Distributional incidence of urban policies depends on heterogeneity on both demand and supply side of the amenities market.

## APPENDIX

## Housing supply inelasticity {#sec-justification}

- On average, annual growth of housing stock in Amsterdam is 1.2%, similar to the 0.9% value for San Francisco, one of the least housing-elastic cities in the US.

- Also, the assumption of inelastic housing supply is broadly in line with other studies of housing supply in the Netherlands (Vermeulen and Rouwendal, 2007).

## Identification of amenity {#sec-identification-amenity}

- Parameterize $F_{sjt}(N_{jt}) = \Lambda_j \Lambda_t \cdot \underbrace{R(N_{jt})}_{\text{annual rental price of commercial real estate}} \cdot \Omega_{sjt}$

- Assume $R(N_{jt}) = N_{jt}^\eta$, where $\eta$ is inverse supply elasticity of real-estate (calibrated).

- Identification issue: Amenity supply shock is correlated with $N_{sjt}$ and $M_{jt}^k$. We need [amenity demand shifters as IV]{.alert}.

- The paper constructs an instrument that shift population composition: $Z_{jt}^k = \omega_t^k \cdot\underbrace{S_{jt}^{\gamma(k)}}_{\text{housing stock by tenancy status}}$.

## Identification of housing supply {#sec-identification-supply}

- OLS estimation leads to bias due to simultaneity bias from regressing quantities on prices. 

- Use shift-share predicted tourist demand as IV.
