## Motivation

#### Innovation is endogenous

- Innovation is not a fixed value, but an equilibrium object determined within the economic model.

- e.g. As firms enjoy great spillover from incumbent innovation, they will have more incentive to enter into market wherer there is more innovation to their liking.

- e.g. Region's innovation will then cater to the need of its industrial composition.

#### How will this relation affect the distribution of firms/establishments across/within regions? 

## Research question

#### How does preference heterogeneity over innovation shape firm sorting across regions?

## Related literature

#### Innovation literature

#### Firm entry and exit literature

#### Spatial expansion of firms

- @rossi, @kleinman, @jiang.
- â†’ *Extending empirical firm network literature.*

#### Place-based policy

## Data overview

#### For US

- **PatentsView** (Universe of patents produced between 1976 to 2022).
- Link patent assignees to the universe of firms in the restricted **US Longitudinal Business Database (LBS)**.
- Advantage: More rich data.
- Disadvantage: Not many significant policy shock that might have affected change in innovation compoistion?

#### For Korea

- **Establishment data**: South Korea has a data that has universe of the location of establishments and can link them around 2007.
- **Innovation data**: I have a data on all the patents and the location of innovators that made such patents from 2000.
- Advantage: Massive innovative city policy was implemented in South Korea starting from 2010.
- Disadvantage: Less rich data, limitation in spatial analysis, etc. 

## Descriptive evidence (reduced-form?)

$$\log(y_{it}) = \alpha_0 + \alpha_1 D_{it} + \delta_i + \delta_t +  \varepsilon_{it}$$

We can check total effect by regressing entry of firms on number of patents.

#### Solving endogeneity issue

- Try to use innovative city project as DiD (input of innovative firms in certain regions)

- Also try some shift-share IV: Total innovation growth in a nation ([shift]{.alert}) and past-share of innovation by classification?

## Structural model

**TBD**

Maybe firm entry model in IO?
