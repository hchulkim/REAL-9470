## Motivation

#### Work-From-Home (wfh) is a prevalent form of working arrangement

- @bloom, @barrero, @criscuolo, @aksoy, @galasso, @brynjolfsson

#### Geographic proximity is important in innovation

- Collaboration at a distance is especially challenging in the early stages of research (@lin-frey-wu).

- wfh can lead to slower pace of innovation, negatively affecting the productivity of the firm.

#### But wfh also has benefits that can boost innovation

- Spread of internet connectivity can lead to increased knowledge flow across locations and higher patenting activity (@chen-frey-presidente, @forman-van1, @forman-van2)

- This is because... (@barrero2)
  + There is opportunity cost to chatting with your coworker in the next-door office.
  + Remote-collaboration tech expand the opportunities to form teams that are optimized for particular research projects and questions.

## Research question

####

Geographical location of innovation important. How is WFH changing this network of innovation? WFH also allowed rise of contactless communication. Did this lessen the impact of geographical importance of innovation?

## Data overview

#### For US

- **PatentsView** (Universe of patents produced between 1976 to 2022).
- Link patent assignees to the universe of firms in the restricted **US Longitudinal Business Database (LBS)**.

#### For Korea

- **Establishment data**: South Korea has a data that has universe of the location of establishments and can link them around 2007.
- **Innovation data**: I have a data on all the patents and the location of innovators that made such patents from 2000.

## Reduced-form Method

$$y_{it}$$

## Structural model

**TBD**
